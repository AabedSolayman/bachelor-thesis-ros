I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my academic supervisor Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Stefan Mack for his kind direction and support when it was needed the most.

I'm extremely grateful to my family for their continuous and unparalleled love, help and support. I express my sincere gratitude to both women, who have given me everything they could; my mom and my fiancee.
